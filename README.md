searchplugins
=============

These search engine plugins for Mozilla Firefox help to reduce your digitial footprint as described in our article [Customize Privacy Settings in Mozilla Firefox: Part 3 (Search Engines)](http://webdevelopmentaid.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/customize-privacy-settings-in-mozilla-firefox-part-3-search-engines "Customize Privacy Settings in Mozilla Firefox: Part 3 (Search Engines) | WebDevelopmentAid")
.

To install these search engine plugins open your File Explorer and navigate to your Firefox profile (under Windows you will find your Firefox profile at C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[PROFILENAME]) where [USERNAME] is replaced by your user name (e.g. John Doe) and [PROFILENAME] is replaced by the name of your Firefox profile (e.g. floou2ja.Default).

There you open the file called "searchplugins" or you create this file in case it does not exist. Then you extract all [DOCUMENTNAME].xml documents you downloaded from this repository in this file.
