searchplugins
=============

These search engine plugins for Mozilla Firefox help to reduce your digitial footprint as described in our article [Customize Privacy Settings in Mozilla Firefox: Part 3 (Search Engines)](http://webdevelopmentaid.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/customize-privacy-settings-in-mozilla-firefox-part-3-search-engines "Customize Privacy Settings in Mozilla Firefox: Part 3 (Search Engines) | WebDevelopmentAid").

To install these search engine plugins open your File Explorer and navigate to your Firefox profile (under Windows you will find your Firefox profile at C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[PROFILENAME]) where [USERNAME] is replaced by your user name (e.g. John Doe) and [PROFILENAME] is replaced by the name of your Firefox profile (e.g. floou2ja.Default).

There you open the folder called "searchplugins" and extract the **content** of the downloaded folder called "searchplugins" to this folder.

In case the folder "searchplugins" does not yet exist in your Firefox profile you extract the downloaded folder "searchplugins" directly to your Firefox profile.
