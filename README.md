## Installation ##
Click "Download ZIP" to download the folder, extract the file "searchplugins" from the ZIP, copy the file "searchplugins" (or its content, respectively) to your Firefox profile.

### Windows ###
Under Windows (tested for Windows 7, 8, 8.1) you will find your Firefox profile at C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[PROFILENAME]) where [USERNAME] is replaced by your user name (e.g. JohnDoe) and [PROFILENAME] is replaced by the name of your Firefox profile (e.g. floou2ja.Default). When using the File Explorer you might have to make visible your hidden folders.

If you already have a folder "searchplugins" in your Firefox profile, copy the **content** of the downloaded and extracted "searchplugins" folder and paste it to your "searchplugins" folder of your Firefox profile.
