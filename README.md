searchplugins
=============

To install these search engine plugins open your Windows File Explorer and navigate to your Firefox profile (C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[PROFILENAME]) where [USERNAME] is replaced by your user name (e.g. John Doe) and [PROFILENAME] is replaced by the name of your Firefox profile (e.g. floou2ja.Default).

There you open the file called "searchplugins" or you create this file in case it does not exist. Then you extract all [DOCUMENTNAME].xml documents you downloaded from this repository.
